# DayPlanner
Title: Day-Planner

Introduction: This project is a web-based application which allows the user to schedule events for each hour of a 24 hour day. The user arrives at the landing page and is presented with an empty daily calendar.  The current date appears at the top of the page.  The far left coloumn contains the labled hourly tags, the center coloumn allows for user input and each input area has its own save button to the right.
The user is able to enter the desired data in whichever time block is desired.  After the save button has been selected for that time block, the data is saved in local storage and will remain even after the page has been refreshed.

Technology: This website utilizes html, css, bootstrap, jquery, fontawesome, and javascript.

Launch: This website can be launched in a browser.

Project Status: This project is complete

I had assistance from my tutor: Mike Munoz on this project.
